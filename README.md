Input Features:
id: Unique identifier for each transaction
V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
Amount: The transaction amount

Output Label:
Class 0.0 (Non-fraudulent transactions): These are normal, legitimate transactions that are not flagged as fraudulent.
Class 1.0 (Fraudulent transactions): These are transactions identified as fraudulent and flagged by the system.

The model demonstrates high precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes, along with an impressive overall accuracy of 98%. This ensures that the model is effective in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
